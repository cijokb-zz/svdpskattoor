    The Sacred heart conference of St. Vincent De Paul  in St. Mary’s Church,
    Kattoor,  located in Trichur district  a part of Irjinalakuda Diocese is
    being started under the spiritual leadership of Rev.Fr. Varghese Pulickan on
    26th September 1948. The conference finds a sense of fulfilment for it has
    succeeded to give recourse to the downtrodden, relief to the sick and those
    who suffer from poverty and thereby spreading the light of happiness through
    its dedication and commitment. In those days the difference between the have
    and the have-nots was so wide that the conference did everything possible to
    fill the gap between the two especially by supporting the needy in all the
    ways possible. Through this the conference communicated a noble message to
    the coming generations.
description: "Members of the Society of St.Vincent de Paul (or \"Vincentians\" )
  are men and women who strive to grow spiritually by offering person-to-person
  service to individuals in need. We are young and old. Our members come in
  every shade of skin color. Some of us are wealthy, some are financially poor,
  but all of us are blessed with an awareness that our blessings (time, talent
  or treasure) are to be shared with our brothers and sisters in need.  We know
  that we are not alone. We are part of an international society of friends
  united by a spirit of poverty, humility, and sharing, which is nourished by
  prayer and reflection, mutually supportive gatherings, and adherence to a
  basic Rule.  Energized by the awareness that service to our brother or sister
  in need is in fact an encounter with our Lord Jesus Christ, members of the
  Society of St. Vincent de Paul are keenly aware that poverty, suffering and
  loneliness are present for millions in our communities. For that reason, we
  collaborate with all who seek to relieve need and address its causes.   The
  Society of St. Vincent de Paul offers tangible assistance to those in need on
  a person-to-person basis. It is this personalized involvement that makes the
  work of the Society unique. This aid may take the form of intervention,
  consultation, or often through direct dollar or in-kind service. An essential
  precept of the Society's work is to provide help while conscientiously
  maintaining the confidentiality and dignity of those who are served. The
  Society recognizes that it must assume, also, a role of advocacy for those who
  are defenseless or voiceless. The list of services of the Society of St.
  Vincent de Paul in the kattoor is endless. No work of charity is foreign to
  the Society. To quote our patron, St. Vincent de Paul: \"Charity is infinitely
  inventive.\""
